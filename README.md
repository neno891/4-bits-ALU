# 4-bits-ALU
This project is a 4-bit Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) designed using Logisim. The ALU performs arithmetic and logical operations on 4-bit inputs and provides a 4-bit output .

Features:
 Arithmetic Operations 
- Addition (`A + B`)  
- Subtraction (`A - B`)  

Logical Operations 
- AND (`A & B`)  
- OR (`A | B`)  
- XOR (`A âŠ• B`)

Control Unit 
- Uses a **3-bit selector** to choose the operation  
- Multiplexer to select between operations  
Outputs  
- 4-bit Result
